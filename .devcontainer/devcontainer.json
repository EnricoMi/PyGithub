Message: AADSTS50020: User account 'suppressortp@aol.com' from identity provider 'live.com' does not exist in tenant 'Aylo' and cannot access the application 'https://mindgeek.zendesk.com'(Zendesk Mindgeek) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
